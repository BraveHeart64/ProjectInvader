The game is going to be a space invaiders like game for Linux. 
As of now, I am able to get the player to move across the screen and shoot.
I loaded two enemy ships, but for now they do not do anything.Next, Thing on the list is hit 
dectection and then I  will fill the screen with ships and add music and sound
