 I am writing this software for fun, but with the desire to possible make a little money off of it. If you like the software
 feel free to use it as long as you do not claim to have written this software. If you are a person who owns a software company
 of any kind and like this piece of software and  use the code ,then by the power of this license 
 consider giving the software developer a code interview and possible a job. I Ryan H Love here by give the user permission to Modify
 the code, make a deritive work, and share the code as long as he or she will give credit to Ryan H Love. the user is only allowed
 to use the code in personal project unless they ask Ryan H Love permission. I Ryan H Love will give permission for any of my works 
 under this Liscense as long as you the user offers me the chance to help program your project, Offer me a Develoer Job or at leaset a code 
 Interview. In a case where I decide not to offer my assistant in your project, then I mostly likey have gotten employed and
 I will most likely give you permission anyways as long as you ask and never claim credit for the base structure of the code.
 
 In closing any code that you added on to the base code is yours to keep.
 
 
 If it is found that somebody violates these simple rules, legal action may occur.
